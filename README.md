## About Dataset

Kickstarter is a popular crowdfunding platform that has helped thousands of entrepreneurs and creators bring their innovative ideas to life. However, not all Kickstarter projects are successful, and understanding the factors that contribute to success or failure can be valuable for both creators and investors alike.

In this dataset, we have collected information on a large number of Kickstarter projects and whether they ultimately succeeded or failed to meet their funding goals. This dataset includes a wide range of project types, including technology startups, creative arts endeavors, and social impact initiatives, among others.

By analyzing this dataset, researchers and analysts can gain insights into the characteristics of successful and unsuccessful Kickstarter projects, such as funding targets, project categories, and funding sources. This information can be used to inform investment decisions and guide future crowdfunding campaigns.

Overall, this dataset provides a comprehensive look at the Kickstarter ecosystem and can serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of crowdfunding and the factors that contribute to project success or failure.
